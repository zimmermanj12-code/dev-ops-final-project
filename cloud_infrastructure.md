# Cloud Infrastructure Overview

Cloud infrastructure refers to the virtualized hardware and software resources needed for cloud computing, such as servers, storage, networking, and data centers, all managed and provided by cloud service providers like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. It enables organizations to scale their IT operations flexibly without maintaining physical hardware. This infrastructure is delivered as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), allowing businesses to rent computing power and storage, improving efficiency and reducing costs. The cloud infrastructure also supports high availability, disaster recovery, and secure data management, making it essential for modern IT operations.
